## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **MCP Examples**: Covers common use-cases, patterns, and custom connectors for the MuleSoft Certified Platform.
2. **UTCP Examples**: Demonstrates how to implement and use UTCP in MuleSoft for advanced connectivity scenarios.

The goal is to provide simple, self-contained examples that can be reused or extended in your MuleSoft projects.

## MCP Examples

- Example 1: Basic integration flow
- Example 2: Custom connector using MCP
- Example 3: Error handling patterns
- Example 4: Secure property usage

## UTCP Examples

- Example 1: Setting up a UTCP connection
- Example 2: Sending and receiving messages via UTCP
- Example 3: UTCP error handling
- Example 4: Advanced UTCP patterns

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
